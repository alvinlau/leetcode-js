# 56. Merge Intervals
# https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-intervals/


# Given an array of intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi], merge all overlapping intervals, and return an array of the non-overlapping intervals that cover all the intervals in the input.


# Example 1:
# Input: intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
# Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
# Explanation: Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlap, merge them into [1,6].


# Example 2:
# Input: intervals = [[1,4],[4,5]]
# Output: [[1,5]]
# Explanation: Intervals [1,4] and [4,5] are considered overlapping.


# Example 3:
# Input: intervals = [[4,7],[1,4]]
# Output: [[1,7]]
# Explanation: Intervals [1,4] and [4,7] are considered overlapping.
 

# Constraints:
# 1 <= intervals.length <= 104
# intervals[i].length == 2
# 0 <= starti <= endi <= 104


# @param {Integer[][]} intervals
# @return {Integer[][]}
def merge(intervals)
  return [] if intervals.empty?

  result = []

  intervals.sort.each do |interval|
    if result.empty? || result.last[1] < interval[0] # no overlap
      result << interval
    else # overlap, merge into the most recent interval
      result.last[1] = [result.last[1], interval[1]].max
      # p "added #{interval} into #{result}"
    end
  end

  result
